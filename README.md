This is a side project site.

This is is a place for:
Node.js
Grunt
Eslint
Winston
Three.js
Postgres
Highcharts
Mocha/Chai
Angular
React
Bootstrap

I'm a vanilla JavaScript fan. Vanilla JS makes it easier to use other frameworks and makes them less 'brittle' for use.  Any redundancies are intentional as this is a site for experimentation.

This site is also a place to list my movie reviews and showcase my animation experiments.
