This is a side project site.

This is is a place for:
Node.js

Postgres
Highcharts
Mocha/Chai
Angular
React

I'm a vanilla JavaScript fan, by the way. If you don't know vanilla JS, you really can't get anywhere useful with these frameworks.

It's also a place to list my movie reviews and showcase my animation experiments.
